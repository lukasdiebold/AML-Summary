# AML Summary Notes

These notes summarize the Advanced Machine Learning lecture at ETH. They are a
work in progress and are intended for personal study and educational use.

## Context and Motivation

I am taking the Advanced Machine Learning lecture in HS25. While the lecture content is rich and technically dense, I personally found the organization and presentation of the material challenging to follow end-to-end.

This script is my attempt to restructure, connect, and internalize the concepts by organizing them into a coherent narrative, filling in missing intuition, and making implicit assumptions more explicit. Writing these notes is primarily a learning exercise, aimed at improving my own understanding of the material.

Some parts were heavily written with AI assistance, so proceed with caution and
verify important details.
